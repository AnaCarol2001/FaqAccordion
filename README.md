### What I learned

In this step of the Introduction to web accessibility learning path, the challenge was to search for a good accordion pattern and to test it manually and using automatic tools. While researching, I came across the Aria and the UK GOV examples, which I used to base my solution to this challenge. To test its accessibility, I learned about and used the Windows Narrator for a manual test and Google Lighthouse for automatic testing (100 in Accessibility).

### Continued development

I intend to continue using progressive enhancement to develop web apps and learn more accessibility testing tools to ensure a better user experience.
